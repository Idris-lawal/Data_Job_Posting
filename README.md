# BACKGROUND
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data was provide by Luke Barousse [SQL course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql),It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
    1.  What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
    2.  What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
    3.  What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
    4.  Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
    5.  What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# TOOLS USED

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.



# THE ANALYSIS

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    B.name AS CompanyName,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact a
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim b On a.company_id = b.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
      job_location ='Anywhere' and salary_year_avg is not NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- Wide Salary Range: Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

        salary_year_avg
    FROM
        job_postings_fact a
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim b On a.company_id = b.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location ='Anywhere' and salary_year_avg is not NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
        LIMIT 10
)
SELECT a.job_id,a.job_title,a.CompanyName,a.salary_year_avg,c.skills
 FROM 
    top_paying_jobsCTE a 
LEFT JOIN
skills_job_dim b ON a.job_id=b.job_id
